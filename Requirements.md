Broad goals for now are:
# Create a new React Project V
Decide how many components you will need/use. They should be able to search for a movie title, see some results, and on a clicking on a movie result we should see information about that individual movie. 
Create these containers/components
Do some initial styling - you may need to look at some docs :wink: - flex is a winner here
Make your data dynamic by using the OMDB API. You will need to register and get an API key to use this API. https://www.omdbapi.com/
Other apis can be used/are better!
